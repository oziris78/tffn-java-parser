# ################    NOTICE CHECKER v2    #################
# ##########################################################
#
# This script performs checks for various project integrity related things.
# 
# These things include: 
#     - Checks for license notices in your source files
#     - Checks for copyright notices in your source files
#     - Checks for any unnecessary empty files (files with 0 bytes)
# 
# Important Notes:
#     - This script is designed to be mainly used by project managers but it can be used by anyone.
#     - This script only does checks and warns the user, IT DOES NOT CHANGE ANY FILE CONTENTS.
#     - This script was written in Python 3.9.0, but it will probably work in all >=3 versions.
#     - You must customize the variables in the "CUSTOMIZABLE VARIABLES" section for this
#         script to work properly
#     - This script has no dependencies, meaning you only need core Python modules to run it.
#         There is no need for any virtual environments (venv's) or PIP installations.
#
